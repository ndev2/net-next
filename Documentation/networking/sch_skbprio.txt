SKB Priority Queue
==================
 
This qdisc schedules a packet according to skb->priority, where a higher
value places the packet closer to the exit of the queue. When the queue is
full, the lowest priority packet in the queue is dropped to make room for
the packet to be added if it has higher priority. If the packet to be added
has lower priority than all packets in the queue, it is dropped.
 
Without the SKB priority queue, queue length limits must be imposed
for individual queues, and there is no easy way to enforce a global queue
length limit across all priorities. With the SKBprio queue, a global
queue length limit can be enforced while not restricting the queue lengths
of individual priorities.
 
This is especially useful for a denial-of-service defense system like
Gatekeeper, which prioritizes packets in flows that demonstrate expected
behavior of legitimate users. The queue is flexible to allow any number
of packets of any priority up to the global limit of the scheduler
without risking resource overconsumption by a flood of low priority packets.
